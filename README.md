User Registration Form - README
This is a simple, responsive user registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes client-side validation to ensure that users enter valid data before submission.
📋 Features
•	Clean and responsive form layout
•	Client-side validation using JavaScript
•	Real-time feedback for errors and successful registration
•	Validation rules:
•	- Username must be at least 3 characters long
•	- Email must include both '@' and '.'
•	- Password must be at least 8 characters long
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone or Download the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Form-Creation-Validation.git
Or simply download the .zip and extract it.
2. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
🧪 How It Works
When the user submits the form:
- JavaScript validates each field.
- If the input is valid:
   • A green 'Registration successful!' message is displayed.
- If any input is invalid:
   • Specific error messages are shown in red.

All logic is handled in the script.js file, and visual styling is handled by style.css.
